# New two-dimensional code/QR code 


## Tiny visual tags for robot cameras
We designed a new two-dimensional code dedicated to acupoints location, with CRC check function, and a new two-dimensional code detection and recognition algorithm is proposed.</br>

## Usage:
    pip install opencv-python
    python two-code-detetor.py
#### Also,you can try other images by changing the code in two-code-detetor.py:</br> 
    image = cv2.imread('./images/0.jpg')
## Show:

 The result represents three centre coordinates of feature points and the value of this two-dimensional code.
