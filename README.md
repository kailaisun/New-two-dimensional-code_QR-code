# New two-dimensional code/QR code 

# The detail decription is in the paper, and the URL will be put here till the conference is held.

## Tiny visual tags for robot cameras
We designed a new two-dimensional code dedicated to acupoints location, with CRC check function, and a new two-dimensional code detection and recognition algorithm is proposed.</br>

## Usage:
    pip install opencv-python</br>
    python two-code-detetor.py</br>
#### Also,you can try other images by changing the code in two-code-detetor.py:</br> 
    image = cv2.imread('./images/0.jpg')</br>
## Show:

 The result represents three centre coordinates of feature points and the value of this two-dimensional code.
